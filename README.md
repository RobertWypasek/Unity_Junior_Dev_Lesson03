This repository contains files for Lesson 3 of Unity Junior Programmer lessons.

In Assets there is a Challenge 3 package, which was prepared for fixing simple bugs based on materials from Lesson 2.

    The background only moves when the game is over
    No objects are being spawned
    Fireworks VFX appears to the side of the baloon
    the background is not repeating properly

This repository contains files for Lesson 3 of Unity Junior Programmer lessons.

In Assets there is a Challenge 3 package, which was prepared for fixing simple bugs based on materials from Lesson 2.

Bugs:
1. The player can't controll the baloon
2. The background only moves when the game is over
3. No objects are being spawned
4. Fireworks VFX appears to the side of the baloon
5. The background is not repeating properly

Bonus: The ballon can float too high

Bonus: The baloon can drop below the ground
